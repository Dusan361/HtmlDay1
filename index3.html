<body>
    <p> <div>
         She's got a smile that it seems to me<br>
        Reminds me of childhood memories<br>
        Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
        </div>
        <div>
        Now and then when I see her face
        She takes me away to that special place
        And if I stare too long, I'd probably break down and cry 
        </div>
        <div>
        Whoa, oh, oh
        Sweet child o' mine
        Whoa, oh, oh, oh
        Sweet love of mine
        </div>
        <div>
        She's got eyes of the bluest skies
        As if they thought of rain
        I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
        Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
        Where as a child I'd hide
        And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by
        </div>
        <div>
        Whoa, oh, oh
        Sweet child o' mine
        Whoa whoa, oh, oh, oh
        Sweet love of mine
        </div>
        <div>
        Whoa, yeah
        Whoa, oh, oh, oh
        Sweet child o' mine
        Whoa, oh, whoa, oh
        Sweet love of mine
        Whoa, oh, oh, oh
        Sweet child o' mine
        Ooh, yeah
        Ooh, sweet love of mine
        </div>

        Where do we go?
        Where do we go now?
        Where do we go?
        Ooh, oh, where do we go?
        Where do we go now?
        Oh, where do we go now?
        Where do we go? (Sweet child)
        Where do we go now?
        Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
        Where do we go now?
        Ah, ah

        Oh, where do we go now?
        Oh, where do we go?
        Oh, where do we go now?
